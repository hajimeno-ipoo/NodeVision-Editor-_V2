## 2025-11-18 Trim modal corner thickening
- Simplified trim crop box visuals: border now 4px solid yellow + corners use the same pill handles as edges (no more L-shape pseudo elements).
- Adjusted handle sizing/offsets so every edge and corner is a solid, easy-to-grab bar that hugs the crop box.
- Rebuilt desktop-electron + ran ui-template Vitest suite; preview HTML refreshed for manual checks.
