Made media preview show cropped videos (not still images). Changes: NodeMediaPreview now carries cropRegion/rotation/zoom/flip metadata; deriveTrimPreview stores crop metadata while keeping video kind and URL. Media preview renderer applies CSS transform to video/img to show cropped area. openTrimModal remains async to capture frame for modal only. Removed unused canvas crop helpers. desktop-electron build passes.
