## 2025-11-16 Serena indexing status
- Re-ran `uvx --from git+https://github.com/oraios/serena serena project index` at repo root to refresh cached symbols.
- Command finished successfully; cache stored at `.serena/cache/typescript/document_symbols_cache_v23-06-25.pkl`.
- Same warning persists about absent worktree `.worktrees/task-1763094873295-668606`, but main repo indexing is unaffected.
