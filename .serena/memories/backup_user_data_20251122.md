Backed up Electron userData workflows before cropper work.
- Source: ~/Library/Application Support/Electron/nodevision-workflows.json
- Backup: tmp/workflows-backup.json
- Note: userData path appears under Electron/, not nodevision-editor; locale/settings not found separately.
- Will avoid deleting or clearing userData during build/run.
