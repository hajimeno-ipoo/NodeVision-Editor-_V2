Fix: Cropped preview black/blocked due to missing file path. Added IPC `nodevision:media:store` in main.ts to write uploads to tempRoot/uploads and return path. preload exposes storeMediaFile. load node now saves upload via IPC, uses file:// URL for playback, stores filePath for ffmpeg. PersistTrimSettings uses filePath to generate cropped previews. Builds/tests pass (`pnpm test`, `pnpm --filter desktop-electron build`).
