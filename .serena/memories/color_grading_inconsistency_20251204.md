# Color Grading System Inconsistency Issues
- **Problem**: Color correction results differ between image (static) and video previews.
- **Cause**:
  - Images use `WebGLLUTProcessor` with high-precision 3D LUTs (same as export).
  - Videos use `WebGLVideoProcessor` with simplified shader approximations for performance.
- **Affected Nodes**:
  - `ColorCorrection`: Significant differences in Temperature, Tint, Shadows/Highlights.
  - `PrimaryGrading`: Differences in Lift/Gamma/Gain logic.
  - `Curves`: Video preview is missing or incomplete.
- **Impact**: Users cannot trust the preview for video grading.
- **Proposed Solution**: Unify the processing pipeline by using 3D LUTs for video previews as well (`WebGLLUTProcessor`), accepting the potential performance cost for accuracy.
